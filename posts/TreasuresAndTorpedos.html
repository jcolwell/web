                    <p>In  my third quarter at The Art Institute of Vancouver I had the opportunity to  learn about programming and game development for Unity3D. During the 11 week  course my classmates and I got the chance to see how Unity works and how to  create a platformer and a shooter.</p>
                    <p>In  the last four weeks of the course we had a chance to put this newly gathered  knowledge to the test. We formed into groups and got to work to making a game.  I had the pleasure of working with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=AAkAABk9LZMBHaLfurrKvKjbM8ZkXjulMeswfE0&authType=NAME_SEARCH&authToken=JS3t&locale=en_US&trk=tyah&trkInfo=clickedVertical%3Amynetwork%2CclickedEntityId%3A423439763%2CauthType%3ANAME_SEARCH%2Cidx%3A1-1-1%2CtarId%3A1441575264350%2Ctas%3ACole">Cole Rudniski</a>, a programmer, and two game  designers; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=AAkAABhyxSEBo-ZHjzC-zFJZr6Sejl_Ru694l2M&authType=NAME_SEARCH&authToken=Gtf1&locale=en_US&trk=tyah&trkInfo=clickedVertical%3Amynetwork%2CclickedEntityId%3A410174753%2CauthType%3ANAME_SEARCH%2Cidx%3A1-2-2%2CtarId%3A1441575286666%2Ctas%3AKevin">Kevin Hill</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=AAkAABjCW-IBODhF3LroT2cZsX46wsPFSvuvSTQ&authType=NAME_SEARCH&authToken=2mdP&locale=en_US&trk=tyah&trkInfo=clickedVertical%3Amynetwork%2CclickedEntityId%3A415390690%2CauthType%3ANAME_SEARCH%2Cidx%3A1-1-1%2CtarId%3A1441575278469%2Ctas%3AVictor">Victoria Wojcik</a>. And with that, Torpedo&rsquo;s Treasures was  born! </p>
                    <p>…Ok  well maybe not quite like that. First we needed to plan what we want to do; <em>a submarine game that the player could  maneuver a 3D environment with the aim of collecting Davy Jones&rsquo; treasure</em>.  Ok that sounds like a start but is there anything else we can add? <em>Enemy submarines to shoot down with  torpedoes?</em> Ah that sounds like an excellent idea! But wait, how does the  player collect Davy Jones' treasure? <em>How  about a magnet?</em> This is an idea to work with!</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <h1><strong>The Player</strong></h1>
                    <p>Now  that we have an idea of what we want to create it was time to get to work. I  had the pleasure of creating the scripts to allow the player to maneuver their  submarine and collect the treasure. </p>
                    <p>Implementing  the controls for our player was very straight forward. Victoria and I had  discussed what our controls should be. Making it just an issue of coding it up.  Cole simplified everything even further by turning off gravity to our game  world allowing us to mimic buoyancy. </p>
                    <p>The  traditional FPS controls of &ldquo;WASD&rdquo; made the foundation of our controls. &ldquo;W&rdquo; and  &ldquo;S&rdquo; allowing the player to move forward and back respectively, while &ldquo;A&rdquo; and  &ldquo;D&rdquo; would allow the player to roll their vessel left and right. The mouse  provide the pitch and yaw authority to complete the player movement. </p>
                  <p>Since  the underlying mechanics of motion for the player are <font face="courier new">RigidBody.MovePosition()</font> commands. However, this did  introduce a small bug. When the player crashed into another object or took an  impact from an enemy torpedo, the vessel would accumulate rotations and  movement that the player could not cancel out. To fix this we opted to set all  rotations and movements to zero before applying the player&rsquo;s inputs, allowing  the player to maintain control.</p>
                    <h1> <br>
                      <strong>The Magnet</strong></h1>
                    <p>When  I was discussing the design of the magnet with Kevin and Victoria, we agreed  that making it easy to use from a gameplay perspective was important to us. To  that end, we decided the magnet would have a fixed extension range and  automatically retract once it either fully extended, or made contact with our  treasure. </p>
                    <p>The  movement of the magnet was powered by a <font face="courier new">Vector3.Lerp()</font> call in the  MagnetController&rsquo;s <font face="courier new">Update()</font>. I used two functions to drive the direction of the  lerp: <font face="courier new">RetractClaw()</font>simplified the process of retracting when making  connection with treasure, while <font face="courier new">ExtendClaw()</font> made extending the magnet  on the player&rsquo;s direction easy to connect with the PlayerController.</p>
                    <p>To  physically move treasure once the magnet made contract we took advantage of  Unity&rsquo;s parental hierarchy and made the treasure a child object of the magnet.  Doing this allowed the positional updates that were applied to the magnet to  also affect the treasure. To destroy and reward players for collecting  treasures we used trigger volumes attached to the player. When the magnet  retracted enough, it crossed into the trigger volume, destroying the treasure  and rewarding the player. </p>
                    <p>Lastly,  the magnet also made use of Unity&rsquo;s <font face="courier new">LineRenderer</font>. We used this feature to  draw a line between the player&rsquo;s submarine and its magnet; give the illusion  that the magnet was connect to the player&rsquo;s submarine. </p>
